# YTSearcher (PYTHON)

This program prompts the user if they are looking for videos or channels, then prompts for the search term and after the user selects from a list of 10 items, the program would open the link in a new browser.

I find this program useful to avoid spending data on YouTube's previews, especially if I'm loading videos using my computer through my phone's limited data.

For this program, it is required to install Youtube's Data API.
To do so, you must first have Python installed. 
Then, open up your command prompt and type the following:

pip install google-api-python-client
