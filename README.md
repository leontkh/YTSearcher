# YTSearcher (PYTHON)

This program prompts the user if they are looking for videos or channels, then prompts for the search term and after the user selects from a list of 10 items, the program would open the link in a new browser.

I plan to make the program create a youtube playlist and add videos to that playlist, but that would be later on

For this program, it is required to install Youtube's Data API
To do so, you must first have Python installed. 
Then, open up your command prompt and type the following:

pip install google-api-python-client
